yes
```
10. The key is generated.
11. Now in your flutter project in your 'android/' directory. Create a new file named 'key.properties' & put the values in it â€“>

```properties
storePassword=P@$$@123
keyPassword=P@$$@123
keyAlias=wallfy
storeFile=/Users/home/Documents/appname.jks
```
12. Go to app level build.gradle. Location 'android/app/build.gradle'.
13. Add the code above `android {` â€“>

```gradle
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
android {
```
14. Add the code above `buildTypes {` â€“>

```gradle
signingConfigs {
    release {
        keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
        keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
        storeFile file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])
        storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
    }
}
```
15. Replace a code in same file â€“>

## Old code

```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
        // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
        signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
    }
}
```

## Replaced code

```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
        // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
    }
}
```
16. We are done setting up all things. Now in terminal run build apk command â€“>

```shell
flutter build apk --release
```
17. If every thing is correct then 'apk will be realeased'.
18. APK File is located in the flutter project's folder. You can go to the folder from terminal also â€“>

```shell
cd ~/Documents/flutterproject/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```
19. Upload it to Google play store.
20. Enjoy It.
